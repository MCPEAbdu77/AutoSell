# AutoSell
This is a bedrock pocketmine (PMMP) plugin which automatically sells the blocks while you mine. The blocks and their prices can be changed in the config.yml file.
This is my first PMMP plugin and I'm very proud of my work. I believe every server owner deserves free plugins and this is one of them. :D More are coming on the way.

# Commands: 
 /autosell <on/off> (/as for short form)
 Toggles autosell.
 
# Editing config.yml
  You will be able to set a world in which AutoSell only works in.
  world: "worldname"
  
  To set Block and their prices: 
   BlockID: "price"
   Example:
    1: "20"      //block id and price
    2:4: "24"    //block id with meta variant and its price
